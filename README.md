## Reflection
This project was developed over a span of **12 months** as part of my **BTech final year project**. The main goal was to apply the knowledge and technologies I had learned during my studies, as well as familiarize myself with documentation for new features.

The project was initially conceived by my mentor, **Dr. Amit Neogi**, whose guidance and feedback were invaluable. After further research and discussion, I designed the wireframes and selected the appropriate technologies to be used.

## Future Improvements
- **Patient Matching Algorithm**: Enhance the system's ability to suggest patients based on more detailed analysis and comparisons.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Implement more advanced analytics and data visualizations to offer better insights.
- **UX/UI Enhancements**: Improve the user experience and interface based on user feedback.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Build mobile applications to increase accessibility and reach for users.
